<b>Introduction </b></br>
Programming using "low-code" tools has recently been very successful. </br>
These tools allow in fact to create applications through the use of graphical interfaces rather than through the writing of source code.</br>
</br>
The programming tool, Node-RED belongs precisely to this family of tools: </br>
it is a practical visual development tool particularly suitable in the Internet of Things. It is a module of Node.js </br>
and therefore it has the advantages, such as responsiveness and integration, of different technologies. </br>
 </br>
In this tutorial you will see how to install Node-RED on your Linux Ubuntu 20.04 server, and how to secure it by limiting full access to your projects only to authorized users.  </br>
 </br>
First, connect to your server via an SSH connection. If you haven't done so yet, following our guide is recommended to connect  </br> 
securely with the SSH protocol. In case of a local server, go to the next step and open the terminal of your server.  </br>
